This is a Python project I worked on during my IT studies. With this Python project, I tried making a 'Packet Tracer'-like solution, 
that can use real hardware network devices. Basically, the idea was that you could create labs, and Python would keep track of the progress.
It would also be possible to save and resume labs.

I used GNS3 to test it and it works.
